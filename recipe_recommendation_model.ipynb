      "\n",
      "The combination of these ingredients is left to simmer over low heat, resulting in succulent, juicy, and tender ingredients covered in thick, rich, and savory sauce. Adobo got its name from the Spanish word adobar, meaning marinade or pickling sauce.\n",

      "Instructions: \n",
      "\n",
      " 1. Slice the garlic into thin pieces. Set aside.\n",

      "3. Separate the oil from the garlic. Set aside. Note: the oil is now garlic infused and can be used to cook other dishes in the future.\n",
      "4. Pour 3 tablespoons of garlic-infused oil on the same pan. Sauté the onion until it starts to caramelize.\n",
      "5. Add pork. Cook until the outer part turns medium brown in color.\n",
      "6. Add soy sauce, white vinegar, oyster sauce, lemon lime soda, and water. Let boil.\n",
      "7. Add cracked peppercorn, bay leaves, and half of the garlic chips. Cover the pan and continue cooking in low heat for 1 hour or until the pork gets tender.\n",

      " Isaw is a popular Filipino street food dish consisting of marinated, boiled, and grilled chicken and pork intestines which are usually coiled and skewered on a stick. Although similar, pork isaw is typically slightly larger and chewier than the chicken version.\n",
      "\n",
      "The marinade is usually prepared with soy sauce, oil, ketchup, garlic, and seasonings. Thoroughly cleaning and boiling the intestines before they are placed on a grill is an essential part of the preparation process because it eliminates all food-born pathogens.\n",

      "4. Add vinegar then simmer until the intestines are tender (about 30 minutes). Set aside until the temperature goes down.\n",

      "6. Skewer the intestine (about 3 to 4 pieces per skewer)\n",
      "7. Grill the intestine while basting with the mixture of cooking oil, banana catsup, and soy sauce\n",

      "\n",
      " Talunan is a unique Filipino dish that is usually made with various cuts of chicken simmered in vinegar-based broth alongside garlic, ginger, and a variety of spices. The name of the dish originates from the Filipino term which means defeated, and the dish was initially prepared with roosters involved in one of the favorite Filipino pastimes – the infamous cockfights.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cock which would lose or die in the fight was employed in the preparation of the dish. Nowadays, talunan is not exclusively related to cockfights, and it is prepared in many Filipino households.\n",

      " Silog refers to a group of Filipino dishes that are traditionally served for breakfast. The name is an abbreviation for sinangang at itlog, meaning fried garlic rice and eggs. The difference between each of these dishes is in the additional component that's served with the garlic rice and eggs, such as tapa (sliced meat), longganisa sausages, tocino bacon, bangus milkfish belly, chorizo, hot dogs, pork chops, Spam, fried chicken, or beefsteak, among others.\n",
      "\n",

      "3. Once the water is gone, fry the hotdogs in the remaining oil for 1 to 2 minutes while slowly rolling it back and forth to prevent it from getting burnt. Set aside.\n",
      "4. Prepare the eggs by heating 4 tablespoons of cooking oil in a pan.\n",
      "5. Once the oil gets hot, crack a piece of egg and start to fry it. As the egg is frying, grab a spoon and scoop the oil from the bottom of the pot. Pour the oil over the egg. Do this until the yolk gets a white covering. Remove the egg and set aside. Do the same step on the other piece of egg.\n",
      "6. Arrange the garlic fried rice, hotdogs, and fried eggs in a plate. Put the slices of tomato on the side.\n",
      "7. Serve with ketchup. Share and enjoy!\n",

      "\n",
      " Inasal na manok is a unique Filipino grilled chicken dish which originated in Bacolod and became the signature dish of the entire Visayas region. It employs various chicken cuts marinated in a mixture of vinegar and numerous spices such as lemongrass, garlic, and ginger.\n",
      "\n",
      "During grilling, the meat is brushed with the annatto-infused oil which provides the chicken with an appetizing golden color and a unique peppery flavor. The dish is usually served alongside annatto-flavored garlic rice and spiced vinegar.\n",

      "Instructions: \n",
